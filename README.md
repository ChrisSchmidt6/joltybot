Jolty Bot for Discord

Uhh I don't really know how to do this, obviously you'll want to use "npm install" to get all the node modules installed, as well as enter
your own bot token into config.js - I also made the GIS EID and API blank in the db/settings.json file as you'll have to use your own there
(this is for the google image search command). That's really all you need to know :)
